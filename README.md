# PFHelper
A Discord bot to help people playing Pathfinder.

In order to run this bot, you must install Discord.js. This is done by opening the terminal in the repository directory and entering the following:
npm install iscord.js

Additionally, Node.js version 7.6 or higher is required to ensure the bot will run correctly.

The token.json file is missing from this repository. This is intentional. To run this bot, add your own token.json file containing the following:

{
	"token": <your token here>
}
